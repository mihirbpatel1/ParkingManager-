This project let you manage a parking garage


It checks if its a Truck, SUV, or Car 
Checks its fule level if it not 100 it re fules it to 100 
Parks the car to a spot on the gride 
Removes the car when done




This project taught me how make a little program which is  managed by mutilple files and run by implementing 
a Makefile.
